The key differences between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP/2:

Multiplexing: 
    HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection, while HTTP 1.1 only allows one request and response to be sent at a time. This reduces the overhead of establishing new connections and improves the performance of the protocol.

Binary protocol: 
    HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol instead of the text-based protocol used in HTTP 1.1. This reduces the size of the data transmitted between the client and server, improving the efficiency of the protocol.

Header compression: 
    HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce the size of header data, which can be significant in HTTP 1.1. This also helps to improve the efficiency of the protocol and reduce latency.

Server push: 
    HTTP/2 allows the server to send multiple responses to a single request, which can improve the speed and efficiency of web applications.

Prioritization: 
    HTTP/2 allows the client to specify the priority of requests, which can improve the responsiveness of the protocol and reduce latency. In HTTP 1.1, all requests are treated equally.

TLS encryption: 
    While HTTPS is optional in HTTP 1.1, it is mandatory in HTTP/2.

    Overall, HTTP/2 offers significant performance improvements over HTTP 1.1, particularly for complex web applications that require multiple requests and responses. However, not all web servers and browsers support HTTP/2, and some older applications may not be compatible with the new protocol.
